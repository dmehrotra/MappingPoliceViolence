== Mapping Police Violence

This project started is a tool for users to more quickly drop infographics from Campaign Zero/Mapping police violence into any Tweet field to rebuff trolls and share information. 

It has two parts to it: 
1.  A backend with a custom CMS built in rails where the data and new infographics can be added edited and deleted.

2. a chrome extension that pulls inforgraphics from the CMS for easy Twitter sharing -with shortcodes -. It can be used as a public-facing WeTheProtesters feed.
