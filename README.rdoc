== Mapping Police Violence

This project started is a tool for users to more quickly drop infographics from Campaign Zero/Mapping police violence into any Tweet field to rebuff trolls and share information. 

It has two parts to it: 
1. a chrome extension that hosts best infographic work, ready for easy Twitter sharing It can be used as a public-facing WeTheProtesters feed.
2. A backend with a custom CMS built in rails  where the data and new infographics can be added.
