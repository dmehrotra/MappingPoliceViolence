== Mapping Police Violence

This is a tool for Campaign Zero/MappingPoliceViolence to share infographics via twitter in order to rebuff trolls and share information. Any user can also download this chrome extension and easily share campaign zero infographics. 

It has two parts to it: 
1.  A backend with a custom CMS built in rails where the data and new infographics can be added edited and deleted.

2. a chrome extension that pulls infographics from the CMS for easy Twitter sharing -with shortcodes -. It can be used as a public-facing WeTheProtesters feed.
