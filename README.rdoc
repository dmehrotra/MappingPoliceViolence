== README

This project started is a tool for users to more quickly drop infographics from Campaign Zero/Mapping police violence into your Tweet field to rebuff trolls. 

It has two parts to it - a chrome extension that hosts best infographic work, ready for easy Twitter sharing. It can be used as a public-facing WeTheProtesters feed.

There is a backen CMS build in rails from where the data and infographics can be added.
